Brushless Motor

1.Speed and Revolution Control:

Enter commands according to the regex and press 'Enter' key. Negative R implies backward rotation. v should always be positive.

The commands entered will not be echoed back. If using Putty, forcing local echoing will make it easier to see the entered commands.

2.Playing melody:

Enter the melody command according to regex and press 'Enter' key. The motor will rotate indefinitely at a fixed speed that makes the melody audible.

3.Note:
The motor can only handle one type of command at one time, reset is needed before new commands.
